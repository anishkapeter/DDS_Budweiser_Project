Please note that some beer styles could potentially fit into multiple categories based on their characteristics and variations across breweries.

This is a good first pass!  Almost 100% accurate.  I do notice a few errors, and I have the following comments:
	1. You classified "American India Pale Lager" as an IPA.  However, Lagers cannot be Ales and Ales cannot be lagers, so this would be a Non-Ale.
	2. "American Black Ale" is also called a black IPA, so I would have expected it be classified as an IPA.
	3. You labeled "Maibock/Helles Bock" as a type of Ale.  However, bocks are a Lager, so it would be a Non-Ale.
	4. You labeled "Other" as an Ale, but that could should have fallen in the Could be an Ale or a Non-Ale Beer.
	5. I would expect to see "Vienna Lager" in the Non-Ale section, because it is a Lager.
	6. You correctly labeled "Baltic Porter" as a lager, even though a porter is considered an Ale.  Good job!
	7. The last category of Could be an Ale or a Non-Ale beer is more of a category for general beer types that could be Ales or Lagers.  This would be things like "Other", "Rye Beer", "Fruit/Vegetable Beer", etc.  You didn't put any of those three styles in this category.
	8. All the beers that you put in the Could be an Ale or Non-Ale beer Category are actually either an Ale or a Lager.  American Barleywine and Belgian Strong Pale Ale are good examples of Ales.  And Dopplebock is a type of Lager.
	9. At the end you said, "Please note that some beer styles could potentially fit into multiple categories based on their characteristics and variations across breweries."  However, this shouldn't be the case.  The IPA category is for beers that are only IPAs.  Non-IPA Ale is for only Ales that aren't IPAs.  Non-Ale is for all other beers that aren't an Ale.  And Could be an Ale or a Non-Ale would be for beers that fit into the Ale or the Non-Ale category ("Other" for example).  So each item in the list should fit into one of the four categories.  
Given this feedback, could you please try categorizing the original list again.  I think you'll get 100% this time!
